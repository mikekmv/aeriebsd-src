.SC "Use on UNIX"
.PP
To print a document that contains mathematics on
the
.UC UNIX
typesetter,
.P1
eqn files | troff
.P2
If
there are any 
.UC TROFF
options, they go after the
.UC TROFF 
part of the command. For example,
.P1
eqn files | troff -ms
.P2
.PP
A compatible version of
.UC EQN
can be used on devices like teletypes and
.UC DASI
and
.UC GSI
terminals
which have half-line forward and reverse capabilities.
To print
equations on a Model 37 teletype, for example, use
.P1
neqn files | nroff
.P2
The language for equations recognized by
.UC NEQN
is identical to that of
.UC EQN,
although of course the output is more restricted.
.PP
To use a
.UC GSI
or
.UC DASI
terminal as the output device,
.P1
neqn files | nroff -T\fIx\fP
.P2
where
.ul
x
is the terminal type you are using,
such as
.ul
300
or
.ul
300S.
.PP
.UC EQN
and
.UC NEQN
can be used with the 
.UC TBL
program[2]
for setting tables that contain mathematics.
Use
.UC TBL
before
.UC [N]EQN ,
like this:
.P1
tbl  files  |  eqn  |  troff
tbl  files  |  neqn  |  nroff
.P2
.SC "Acknowledgments"
.PP
We are deeply indebted to J. F. Ossanna,
the author of
.UC TROFF ,
for his willingness to extend
.UC TROFF
to make our task easier,
and for his
continuous assistance during the development
and evolution
of
.UC EQN .
We are also grateful to A. V. Aho
for advice on language design,
to S. C. Johnson for assistance with
the
.UC YACC
compiler-compiler,
and to all the
.UC EQN
users
who have made helpful suggestions and criticisms.
