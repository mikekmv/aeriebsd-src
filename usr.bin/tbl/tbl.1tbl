.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm tbl
.Op Ar files
.Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a preprocessor for formatting tables for
.Xr nroff
or
.Xr troff 1 .
The input files are copied to the standard output, except for lines between
\&.TS and
\&.TE command lines, which are assumed to describe tables
and are reformatted.
Details are given in the 
.%T TBL
reference manual.
.Sh EXAMPLE
.Pp
As an example, letting \et represent a tab (which should be typed as a genuine
tab) the input
.Bd -literal -offset indent
\&.TS

If no arguments are given,
.Nm
reads the standard input, so it may be used as a filter.  When 
.Nm
is used with
.Xr eqn
or
.Xr neqn
the
.Nm
command should be first, to minimize the volume of data passed through pipes.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in Version 7 AT&T UNIX.
