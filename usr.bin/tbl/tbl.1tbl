.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm tbl
.Op Ar files
.Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a preprocessor for formatting tables for
.Xr nroff
or
.Xr troff 1 .
The input files are copied to the standard output, except for lines between
\&.TS and
\&.TE command lines, which are assumed to describe tables
and are reformatted.
Details are given in the 
.%T TBL
reference manual.
.Sh EXAMPLE
.Pp
As an example, letting \et represent a tab (which should be typed as a genuine
tab) the input
.Bd -literal -offset indent
\&.TS

If no arguments are given,
.Nm
reads the standard input, so it may be used as a filter.  When 
.Nm
is used with
.Xr eqn
or
.Xr neqn
the
.Nm
command should be first, to minimize the volume of data passed through pipes.
