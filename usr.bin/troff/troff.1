.Sh NAME
.Nm troff ,
.Nm nroff
.Nd text formatting and typesetting
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm troff
.Op Ar option
.Ar ...
.Op Ar file
.Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Troff
formats text in the named
.Ar files
for printing on a Graphic Systems
.Tn C/A/T
phototypesetter;
Its capabilities are described in the
.%T Nroff/Troff user's manual .
.Pp
If no
.Ar file
argument is present, the standard input is read.
An argument consisting of a single minus
.Pq Fl
is taken to be a file name corresponding to the standard input.
The options, which may appear in any order so long as they appear
before the files, are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl o Ar list
Print only pages whose page numbers appear in the comma-separated
.Ar list
of numbers and ranges.
A range
.Ar N\-M
means pages
.Ar N
through
.Ar M ;
an initial
.Ar \-N
means from the beginning to page
.Ar N ;
and a final
.Ar N\-
means from
.Ar N
to the end.
.It Fl n Ar N
Number first generated page
.Ar N .
.It Fl s Ar N
Stop every
.Ar N
pages.
.Nm Troff
will stop the phototypesetter every
.Ar N
pages, produce a trailer to allow changing cassettes,
and resume when the typesetter's start button is pressed.
.It Fl m Ar name
Prepend the macro file
.Pa /usr/lib/tmac/tmac. Ns Em name
to the input
.Ar files .
.It Fl r Ns Ar aN
Set register
.Ar a
(one-character) to
.Ar N .
.It Fl i
Read standard input after the input files are exhausted.
.It Fl q
Invoke the simultaneous input-output mode of the
.Ic rd
request.
.It Fl t
Direct output to the standard output instead of the phototypesetter.
.It Fl f
Refrain from feeding out paper and stopping
phototypesetter at the end of the run.
.It Fl w
Wait until phototypesetter is available, if currently busy.
.It Fl b
Report whether the phototypesetter is busy or available.
No text processing is done.
.It Fl a
Send a printable
.Tn ASCII
approximation of the results to the standard output.
.It Fl p Ar N
Print all characters in point size
.Ar N
while retaining all prescribed spacings and motions,
to reduce phototypesetter elapsed time.
.It Fl F Ar fontdir
The directory
.Ar fontdir
contains the font width tables instead of the default directory
.Pa /usr/libdata/troff_font .
This option can be used to produce output for devices
besides the phototypesetter.
.El
.Pp
If the file
.Pa /var/account/tracct
is writable,
.Nm troff
keeps phototypesetter accounting records there.
The integrity of that file may be secured by making
.Nm troff
a  'set user-id' program.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/libdata/troff_font/ftXXXX -compact
.It Pa /tmp/ta*
Temporary file.
.It Pa /usr/share/tmac/tmac.*
Standard macro files.

.It Pa /usr/libdata/troff_font/ftXX*
Font width tables for

.Pa /dev/cat
phototypesetter.
.It Pa /var/account/tracct
Accounting statistics for
.Pa /dev/cat .
