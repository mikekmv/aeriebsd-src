.Sh NAME
.Nm plot
.Nd graphics filters
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm plot
.Op Fl T Ar terminal
.Op Fl r Ar resolution
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These commands read plotting instructions (see
.Xr plot 5 )
from the standard input or the specified
.Ar files  ,
and in general
produce plotting instructions suitable for
a particular
.Ar terminal
on the standard output.
The
.Fl r
flag may be used to specify the device's output resolution
(currently only the Imagen laser printer understands this option).
.Pp
If no
.Ar terminal
type is specified, the environment parameter
.Ev $TERM
(see
.Xr environ 7 )
is used.
Known
.Ar terminals
are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm 4013
Tektronix 4013 storage scope.
.It Cm 4014 No \&or Cm tek
Tektronix 4014 or 4015 storage scope with Enhanced Graphics Module.
(Use 4013 for Tektronix 4014 or 4015 without the Enhanced Graphics Module).
.It Cm 450
.Tn DASI
Hyterm 450 terminal (Diablo mechanism).
.It Cm 300
.Tn DASI
300 or
.Tn GSI
terminal (Diablo mechanism).
.It Cm 300S
DASI 300S terminal (Diablo mechanism).
.It Cm aed
.Tn AED
512 color graphics terminal.
.It Cm bitgraph No \&or Cm bg
.Tn BBN
bitgraph graphics terminal.
.It Cm imagen No \&or Cm \&ip
Imagen laser printer (default 240 dots-per-inch resolution).
.It Cm crt
Any crt terminal capable of running
.Xr vi  1  .
.It Cm dumb
Dumb terminals without cursor addressing or line printers.
.It Cm vt125
DEC vt125 terminal.
.It Xo
.Cm hp2648 No \&or Cm \&hp
.No \&or Cm hp8

.It Cm ver
Versatec D1200A printer-plotter.
.It Cm var
Benson Varian printer-plotter.
.It Cm xterm
.Tn X11
.Xr xterm 1
flavour of the DEC vt220 terminal (a synonym for
.Cm 4014
and
.Cm tek ).
.El
.Pp
These versions of
.Nm plot
use the
.Fl g
option of
.Xr lpr  1
to send the result directly to the plotter device rather than to
the standard output.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Ev TERM
Used to determine the terminal type if not given as an argument.
