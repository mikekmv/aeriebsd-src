.Sh NAME
.Nm spline
.Nd interpolate smooth curve
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm spline
.Op Fl a
.Op Fl k Ar constant
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
takes pairs of numbers from the standard input as abcissas and ordinates
of a function.
It produces a similar set, which
is approximately equally spaced and
includes the input set, on the standard output.
The cubic spline output
(R. W. Hamming,
.ft I
Numerical Methods for Scientists and Engineers,
.ft R
2nd ed., 349ff)
has two continuous derivatives,
and sufficiently many points to look smooth when plotted, for
example by
.IR  graph (1G).
.Pp
The following options are recognized,
each as a separate argument.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Supply abscissas automatically (they are missing from
the input); spacing is given by the next
argument, or is assumed to be 1 if next argument is not a number.
.It Fl k Ar k
The constant
.Ar k
used in the boundary value computation

(2nd deriv. at end) = k*(2nd deriv. next to end)
..
.br
is set by the next argument.
By default
.Ar k ""
= 0.
.It Fl n
Space output points so that approximately
.I n
intervals occur between the lower and upper
.I x
limits.  (Default
.I n
= 100.)
.It Fl p
Make output periodic, i.e. match derivatives at ends.
First and last input values should normally agree.
.It Fl x
Next 1 (or 2) arguments are lower (and upper) 
.I x
limits.
Normally these limits are calculated from the data.
Automatic abcissas start at lower limit
(default 0).
.Sh "SEE ALSO"
.Xr graph 1 ,
.Xr plot 1
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
When data is not strictly monotone in
.I x,
.Nm
reproduces the input without interpolating extra points.
