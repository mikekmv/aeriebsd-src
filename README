1. WHAT TO DO?
2. WHO IS TO BLAME?
3. DO WE EAT CHICKEN WITH BARE HANDS?

.
	- read style(9) for sources formating guide;
	- always build in the obj/ tree (make obj);
	- always run a 'make depend' when building individual progs
	  although 'make build' will do it for you;
	- first build and install build tools
	  (share/mk, pcc, xlint, as, ld, nroff, make, sh, sed, awk);
	- make build;

etc/
	- changing any of the MAKEDEV goodies also generates mans;

lib/libssl/
	- on new version import needs mans regen from .pod to .man
	  (see makefile for the rules);

sys/
	- updating *devs files first commits to the source and then
	  separately the generatees and optionally affected sources;
	- updating syscalls files first commits into syscalls.master
	  and then separately generated *.[ch] files;
	- adding sysctl entries also involves adding 'em to sysctl(3,8);
	  check kdump if the name lists tree has to updated;

usr.sbin/httpd/
	- may require Configure tweaking;

rejoice!
