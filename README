1. WHAT TO DO?
2. WHO IS TO BLAME?
3. DO WE EAT CHICKEN WITH BARE HANDS?

.
	- read style(9) for sources formating guide;
	- always build in the obj/ tree (make obj);
	- first build and install build tools
	  (pcc, as, ld, nroff, make, sh, awk);
	- make build;

etc/
	- changing any of the MAKEDEV goodies also generates mans;

lib/
	- adding new names to a lib requires minor bump;
	- changing existing api/abi requires a major bump;

lib/libssl/
	- on new version import needs mans regen from .pod to .man
	  (see makefile for the rules);

sys/
	- updating *devs files first commits to the source and then
	  separately the generatees and optionally affected sources;

usr.sbin/httpd/
	- may require Configure tweaking;

rejoice!
