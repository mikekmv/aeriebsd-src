       This library implements the Blowfish cipher, which was
       invented and described by Counterpane (see
       http://www.counterpane.com/blowfish.html ).

       Blowfish is a block cipher that operates on 64 bit (8
       byte) blocks of data.  It uses a variable size key, but
       typically, 128 bit (16 byte) keys are considered good for
       strong encryption.  Blowfish can be used in the same modes
       as DES (see _d_e_s___m_o_d_e_s(7)).  Blowfish is currently one of
       the faster block ciphers.  It is quite a bit faster than
       DES, and much faster than IDEA or RC2.

       Blowfish consists of a key setup phase and the actual
       encryption or decryption phase.

       _B_F___s_e_t___k_e_y_(_) sets up the BBFF__KKEEYY kkeeyy using the lleenn bytes
       long key at ddaattaa.

       _B_F___e_c_b___e_n_c_r_y_p_t_(_) is the basic Blowfish encryption and
       decryption function.  It encrypts or decrypts the first 64
       bits of iinn using the key kkeeyy, putting the result in oouutt.
       eenncc decides if encryption (BBFF__EENNCCRRYYPPTT) or decryption
       (BBFF__DDEECCRRYYPPTT) shall be performed.  The vector pointed at by
       iinn and oouutt must be 64 bits in length, no less.  If they
       are larger, everything after the first 64 bits is ignored.

       The mode functions _B_F___c_b_c___e_n_c_r_y_p_t_(_), _B_F___c_f_b_6_4___e_n_c_r_y_p_t_(_)
       and _B_F___o_f_b_6_4___e_n_c_r_y_p_t_(_) all operate on variable length
       data.  They all take an initialization vector iivveecc which

       needs to be passed along into the next call of the same
       function for the same message.  iivveecc may be initialized
       with anything, but the recipient needs to know what it was
       initialized with, or it won't be able to decrypt.  Some
       programs and protocols simplify this, like SSH, where iivveecc
       is simply initialized to zero.  _B_F___c_b_c___e_n_c_r_y_p_t_(_) operates
       on data that is a multiple of 8 bytes long, while
       _B_F___c_f_b_6_4___e_n_c_r_y_p_t_(_) and _B_F___o_f_b_6_4___e_n_c_r_y_p_t_(_) are used to
       encrypt an variable number of bytes (the amount does not
       have to be an exact multiple of 8).  The purpose of the
       latter two is to simulate stream ciphers, and therefore,
       they need the parameter nnuumm, which is a pointer to an
       integer where the current offset in iivveecc is stored between
       calls.  This integer must be initialized to zero when iivveecc
       is initialized.

       _B_F___c_b_c___e_n_c_r_y_p_t_(_) is the Cipher Block Chaining function for
       Blowfish.  It encrypts or decrypts the 64 bits chunks of
       iinn using the key sscchheedduullee, putting the result in oouutt.  eenncc
       decides if encryption (BF_ENCRYPT) or decryption
       (BF_DECRYPT) shall be performed.  iivveecc must point at an 8
       byte long initialization vector.

       _B_F___c_f_b_6_4___e_n_c_r_y_p_t_(_) is the CFB mode for Blowfish with 64
       bit feedback.  It encrypts or decrypts the bytes in iinn
       using the key sscchheedduullee, putting the result in oouutt.  eenncc
       decides if encryption (BBFF__EENNCCRRYYPPTT) or decryption
       (BBFF__DDEECCRRYYPPTT) shall be performed.  iivveecc must point at an 8
       byte long initialization vector. nnuumm must point at an
       integer which must be initially zero.

       _B_F___o_f_b_6_4___e_n_c_r_y_p_t_(_) is the OFB mode for Blowfish with 64
       bit feedback.  It uses the same parameters as
       _B_F___c_f_b_6_4___e_n_c_r_y_p_t_(_), which must be initialized the same
       way.

       _B_F___e_n_c_r_y_p_t_(_) and _B_F___d_e_c_r_y_p_t_(_) are the lowest level func-
       tions for Blowfish encryption.  They encrypt/decrypt the
       first 64 bits of the vector pointed by ddaattaa, using the key
       kkeeyy.  These functions should not be used unless you imple-
       ment 'modes' of Blowfish.  The alternative is to use
       _B_F___e_c_b___e_n_c_r_y_p_t_(_).  If you still want to use these func-
       tions, you should be aware that they take each 32-bit
       chunk in host-byte order, which is little-endian on lit-
       tle-endian platforms and big-endian on big-endian ones.

       Applications should use the higher level functions
       _E_V_P___E_n_c_r_y_p_t_I_n_i_t(3) etc. instead of calling the blowfish
       functions directly.
